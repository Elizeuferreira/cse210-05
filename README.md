# Cycle

Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

python3 -m pip install raylib

After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 Cycle

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
